# match-info-table

I would like to build a table populated with match information that is filtered under 4 tabs, namely all, live, finished, and schedule, and a side bar next to it that is populated with names of leagues like; KPL, Premier League, Ligue 1, La Liga. When I click on each tab I get categorized matches for each tab
